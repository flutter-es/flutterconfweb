# Flutter Conf Latam Web

Official website of Flutter Conf Latam built with Flutter Web.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK**: 3.35.3
- **Dart SDK**: >=3.9.0 <4.0.0
- **Firebase CLI**: For deployment and Firebase configuration
  ```bash
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```
- **Google Chrome**: To run the application in development mode

## Initial Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flutterconfweb
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure Firebase

This project uses Firebase for:

- Cloud Firestore
- Cloud Functions
- Firebase Analytics
- Firebase Storage
- Firebase Hosting

#### Configuration steps:

1. Create a project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

2. Configure Firebase for web:
    - In Firebase Console, go to Project Settings
    - Add a web application
    - Copy the Firebase configuration

3. Configure FlutterFire:
   ```bash
   # Install FlutterFire CLI if you don't have it
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

   # Configure Firebase for the project
   flutterfire configure
   ```

4. Login to Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

### 4. Configure environment variables (keys.json)

The project uses a `keys.json` file to store configuration variables like URLs and external links. This file is required for building the application.

Create a `keys.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "COUNTRY_PAGE_URL": "https://example.com/country-page",
  "TICKET_PAGE_URL": "https://example.com/tickets",
  "CFP_FORM_URL": "https://example.com/call-for-papers",
  "APP_STORE_URL": "https://apps.apple.com/app/your-app-id",
  "GOOGLE_APP_URL": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=your.package.name",
  "VENUE_MAP_URL": "https://maps.google.com/your-venue-location",
  "CONTACT_EMAIL": "contact@example.com",
  "FCL_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL": "https://example.com/privacy-policy"
}
```

**Important**: Replace all example URLs with your actual project URLs.

**Note**: This file should not be committed to version control if it contains sensitive information. Add it to `.gitignore` if necessary.

### 5. Generate localization files

The project supports multiple languages (English and Spanish). Generate the localization files:

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

Translation files are located at:

- `lib/l10n/arb/intl_en.arb` (English)
- `lib/l10n/arb/intl_es.arb` (Spanish)

## Development

### Run in development mode

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Run with hot reload

Flutter Web supports hot reload. Changes will be reflected automatically while the application is running.

### Build for production

```bash
flutter build web --release
```

Compiled files will be generated in `build/web/`

## Project Structure

├── images/          # Website images
└── markdown/        # Markdown content
```

## Localization (l10n)

### Add new translations

1. Edit the `.arb` files in `lib/l10n/arb/`
2. Regenerate localization files:
   ```bash
   flutter gen-l10n
   ```

### Recommended VSCode extension

To facilitate editing `.arb` files, we recommend installing:
[ARB Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.arb-editor)

## Deployment to Firebase Hosting

### Build and deploy

```bash
# 1. Build the application
flutter build web --no-tree-shake-icons --dart-define-from-file=keys.json

# 2. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --project <PROJECT_ID> --only hosting
```

### Hosting configuration

Hosting configuration is located in `firebase.json` and includes:

- Cache control for JavaScript files
- Rewrites for SPA routing
- Public directory: `build/web`

## Useful Scripts

### Generate code (build_runner)

If you need to generate code with `json_serializable` or other generators:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Code analysis

The project uses `very_good_analysis` to maintain code quality:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

## Main Dependencies

- **firebase_core**: Firebase initialization
- **cloud_firestore**: Database
- **go_router**: Navigation and routing
- **hooks_riverpod**: State management
- **flutter_animate**: Animations
- **google_fonts**: Google fonts
- **intl**: Internationalization

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Flutter SDK not found"
Verify that Flutter is installed correctly and in your PATH:
```bash
flutter doctor
```

### l10n error
Regenerate localization files:
```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

### Firebase issues
Make sure you have executed:
```bash
flutterfire configure
```

### keys.json not found
Ensure you have created the `keys.json` file in the root directory as described in the configuration section.
